Prometheus Server

Assignment requires application of Prometheus, Node Exporter, and Grafana installed on Ubuntu OS. Learning objectives are skills in port mapping using Docker container, usage of wget to download packages, and experience in server configuration.
Prometheus software used for event monitoring and alerting. It is open-source software. Prometheus records real time metrics in a series database. It is using HTTP pull model, flexible queries, and provides real-time alerting. Typical Prometheus monitoring platform includes following tools:
  * Prometheus - centralized point of management and storage facility for metrics
  * Exporters - run on multiple hosts to export their metrics
  * Alertmanager - triggers alerts based on metrics
  * Grafana - information visualization and produce dashboards
  * PromQL - query language to perform alerts and compose dashboards
Each metric has a name. Metric is a form for data storage. Metric name used for referencing and querying. Each metric may have number of labels. Labels include info on data source (source server) and other application related information (HTTP status code, query method GET or POST, endpoints, etc.) Prometheus collects data in form of time series. Prometheus serves issues query to exporters at specific time rate (polling frequency) and upon arrival of info, it aggregates it. At specified condition, Prometheus triggers alert, then alerts are forwarded to Alertmanager. Alertmanager may silence it or forward alerts via emails, Slack, or notifications. Dashboards generated by Grafana.

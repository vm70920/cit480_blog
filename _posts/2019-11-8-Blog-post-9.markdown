<h2>Fail2ban</h2>

Fail2ban is a log parsing software that protects servers from brute-force attack by catching symptoms of automated attack. It carries intrusion prevention functionality. Compatible with POSIX systems with preinstalled local firewall or packet-control system. Fail2ban has no intention to replace local firewalls. Operates with both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. Software operates by reading log files in /var/log directory and runs scripts based on specific settings. Most common task is to block selected IP addresses of hosts that trying to breach security. For instance, it will block IP address of the host that trying to make multiple unsuccessful login attempts, assume performing dictionary attack. Fail2ban configured to unban suspicious hosts after some time. Administrator may specify time frame that banned hosts will be blocked. In case if suspicious host keep coming back, longer ban may be applied. Functionality of Fail2ban allows to perform actions in response to attack: may send email notification according to mail list, may update tables and rules of local firewall software, etc.

<h2>Configure Fail2ban</h2>

Firstly, Fail2ban reads ```.conf``` configuration file, then ```.local``` files override any settings, thus all configuration changes done in ```.local``` files. Default configuration profile contained in ```fail2ban.conf```, in case if customization to settings required, then it is better to make changes in separate file named ```failban.local``` (this file will override ```fail2ban.conf```). To make a copy of current ```.conf``` and rename it:

    cp /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.conf /etc/fail2ban/fail2ban.local

Values that can be changed:

 - ```loglevel```: level of log detailes may be set to 1=error, 2=warn, 3=info, 4=debug
 - ```logtarget```: specifies file to log actions. Default value of /var/log/fail2ban.log file will be logged in specified file
 - ```socket```: location of the socket files
 - ```pidfile```: location of the PID files
